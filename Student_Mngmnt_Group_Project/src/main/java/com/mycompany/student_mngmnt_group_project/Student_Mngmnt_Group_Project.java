//PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

/*
-----
This project is a Student Management System 
that should be able to handle various operations,
including adding students, tracking grades, 
calculating averages, and generating reports (highest/lowest grades),
and File input/output for loading/saving information respectively
-----
The system should display a menu with options for users to select operations 
like adding, removing, or viewing student details
-----
At LEAST three key classes:
- `Student` (attributes: ID, name, grades, etc.)
- `Subject` (attributes: name, grade, etc.)
- `StudentManagementSystem` (handling all system operations)

- Apply the principles of Encapsulation to ensure data hiding.
- Use Inheritance and Polymorphism where appropriate

REPORTS:
The system should generate reports such as
- Average grade for each student
- Highest and lowest grades for a specific subject
- A list of students sorted by grade

Remember to ensure error handling and input validation
